## ðŸ“± Mini Social Media | Learning Project for Post Management

Mini Social Media is a web application developed as part of my learning journey in frontend development. The project focuses on enabling users to Create and publish posts, simulating core functionality found in modern social media platforms.

The primary goal of this project was to gain practical experience in building interactive user interfaces, managing application state, and working with dynamic user-Creation content. It also provided hands-on exposure to form handling, conditional rendering using React.
